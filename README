This is a customized version of file_column gem that works with Rails 3 and mini_magick

FEATURES
========

Let's assume an model class named Entry, where we want to define the "image" column
as a "file_upload" column.

class Entry < ActiveRecord::Base
  file_column :image
end

* every entry can have one uploaded file, the filename will be stored in the "image" column

* files will be stored in "public/entry/image/<entry.id>/filename.ext"

* Newly uploaded files will be stored in "public/entry/tmp/<random>/filename.ext" so that
  they can be reused in form redisplays (due to validation etc.)

* in a view, "<%= file_column_field 'entry', 'image' %> will create a file upload field as well
  as a hidden field to recover files uploaded before in a case of a form redisplay

* in a view, "<%= url_for_file_column 'entry', 'image' %> will create an URL to access the
  uploaded file. Note that you need an Entry object in the instance variable @entry for this
  to work.

* easy integration with mini_magick to resize images and/or create thumb-nails.

USAGE
